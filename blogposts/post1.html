                        <h3 id="overview">Project Overview:</h3>
                        <p>
                              When I set out to create a Digital Dash for my 350z I faced many challenges and unanswered questions. I spent many
                              weekends testing and figuring out solutions that simply weren't documented anywhere online. This post is my way of
                              sharing what I've learned so that others attempting a similar project have the information I wish I'd had at the
                              start. If you're looking, to build your own Digital Dash, consider this a guide or at least some
                              inspiration.<br><br>
                        
                              So, what exactly is this Digital Dash? As the name suggests, it's a system that displays and logs a wide range of
                              real-time data from your car, sourced from various inputs including an OBDII scanner, accelerometer, gyroscope,
                              and
                              GPS. This data can be displayed and logged for virtually any use case you can imagine. A few examples include: AFR
                              (air fuel ratio), boost pressure, oil temp, coolant temp, throttle position, intake manifold pressure, fuel
                              pressure, RPM, speed, check engine lights, G-force meter, 0-60 timer, lap timer, maintenance interval tacking,
                              etc. The possibilities are endless, limited only by your creativity and the available data inputs. This project is
                              powered by a Raspberry pi 4 Model B (8GB) running <a href="https://konstakang.com/devices/rpi4/AOSP13/">AOSP (Android 13)</a>, equipped with an Adafruit Ultimate GPS HAT
                              and MPU-6050 6-axis module for enhanced data collection. All of this is powered by the car's 12v system and
                              displayed through a custom Android app I'm developing to visualize and log the data.
                        </p>

                        <br>


                        <h3 id="intro">Okay now let's jump into it: </h3>
                        <p>
                              This project began when I was having constant overheating issues with my 350z and realized that the factory coolant
                              temperature gauge wasn't cutting it. The stock gauge is very low resolution and by the time it indicates
                              temperatures are rising it's too late and the car’s already overheating. I needed a better solution, one that
                              could provide real-time, accurate numerical readings. Luckily, I had a Raspberry pi 4B (8GB) sitting around from
                              an old project of mine where I had it running Pi-hole. After I did some research on what the best way to do this
                              would be. I found there was a project out there called KonstaKANG.com where they were able to get LineageOS
                              working on a Raspberry pi. So, I downloaded <a href="https://konstakang.com/devices/rpi4/AOSP13/"> AOSP (Android 13)</a> off their website and got that installed. I followed this fantastic <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=reuH6NEk6B4">YouTube tutorial</a> to get it up and running on my pi.
                              This laid the groundwork for the custom Digital Dash I was about to create.
                        </p>

                        <h3 id="whyapi">Why I chose a Pi:</h3>
                        <p>
                              Let me explain the reasoning on why I decided to go with a Raspberry pi, specifically a pi that is running android
                              13 on it. I was looking to learn more about android development and when I needed some gauges for the Z this just
                              seemed like the perfect opportunity. Why use a pi? Well because they are cheap, I had one lying around, they have
                              bluetooth which in order to retrieve data from the ECU I had two options either tap into the CAN bus of the Z and
                              try to decode the data or two simply use a OBDII scanner and connect to that via bluetooth. I opted for option two
                              and am using an OBDII scanner, specifically <a href="https://www.amazon.com/BAFX-Products-Wireless-Bluetooth-Diagnostic/dp/B005NLQAHS">this one</a>. 
                              The downside to this compared to CAN bus is that in my case I
                              get slightly less data, for example I can not access the oil temp sensor data and the data transfer speeds are
                              also slower. But for my purposes and must other purposes this is perfectly fine and I still get access to all the
                              important data I want. Another plus is that the GPIO pins on the Raspberry pi allowed me to set up a shut down script easily
                              plus the added benefit is that I could expanded the features I need in the future to use hardwired data inputs
                              like (gps, accelerometer, gyroscope, etc.) all of which are features I ended up adding. 
                              More on those additional add ons, I am running a <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/2324">Adafruit Ultimate GPS HAT for Raspberry pi</a> this gives me access to GPS features so I can
                              track things like lap times, 0-60 times, speed and other GPS related features. In the future, I plan to integrate these capabilities into the Android app I’m developing to display all this data. Now I also
                              have another add-on board that has an accelerometer, and gyroscope on it to collect more data for things like a
                              G-meter and another way to collect data during track days. Here is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/HiLetgo-MPU-6050-Accelerometer-Gyroscope-Converter/dp/B01DK83ZYQ?source=ps-sl-shoppingads-lpcontext&ref_=fplfs&smid=A30QSGOJR8LMXA&th=1">the module I am using</a>. 
                              To get this all working together I soldered on some new pins to the adafruit HAT on the: SDA, SCD, #18 pin (for shutdown script), three
                              GND, one 5v, one 3v and then was able to connect that to my MPU-6050 module. All you need to do to get this
                              working is connect the SDA and SCD pins plus a 5v power and ground from the pi to the MPU-6050 module to the ones
                              on the adafruit or GPIO pins on the Raspberry pi. This lets everything talk and work together.
                        </p>

                              Finally, how do we actually display the data, and how can you, the user, interact with it? Well I found the perfect
                              solution for my self. My 350Z has an opening where the factory navigation system used to be. Since it hasn’t worked since I’ve
                              owned the car, I decided to remove it and replace it with a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/SunFounder-Raspberry-Touchscreen-1024%C3%97600-Capacitive/dp/B07Y889J3X/ref=sr_1_21?crid=222H27RJNFPZ3&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.jR_TlBjuixZvAHi-ZnuXc7X_T_IJLCVz3qjyNpoAUSxNQm1zg_yx_JEBNMIUrmbwJbWVSBCUrjTX8EwAAOAIiR3loRKPiVOPr9ZLpXlvSznaGCAMsGusoVv5_1vf3Zgp8gp6WuZtbdtBMj_lRBBoi_aP0vYirC5y4-8Dho087zHVxPb5VNMBSCuAAAkFIEvU0a5bcjAKuI7SINIFbQs9epztgYQ-ZdahH8ljqRMJjlxCN-4vMzcwYeG7kChzt6GMOvZpessbHsfS33DvHuezoLOdXB7P_5xbkj83zvsf1bw.OlIqTvJ-sgmdMbSFXoTZPbzHDfl4wW99XLQ0nx6Vzug&dib_tag=se&keywords=raspberry+pi+4+display+touchscreen&qid=1732762110&s=electronics&sprefix=raspberry+pi+4+display+touchscreen,electronics,144&sr=1-21&th=1">7-inch touchscreen display</a> like this one.

                        <p>
                              To install the screen, I ran an HDMI cable and a Micro USB to USB-A cable from the screen’s location back to the
                              glove box area behind the passenger seat, where I store the Raspberry pi and all the additional hardware. Note
                              that I had to use a 270-degree HDMI adapter to make the screen fit properly and also trim a bit of the plastic
                              inside the dash. All the cutting is internal and not visible once installed.

                              In my case, the cover that normally goes over the navigation opening is missing, so trimming the inside wasn’t an
                              issue. However, if you still have the cover in your 350z, you’ll want to make sure your modifications don’t interfere with its
                              opening and closing mechanism.

                              In order to get the screen to sit flush with the trim I made a custom mount using parts of the old factory nav
                              mounting system to get the angle right plus my own custom bits using some bolts and nuts to get the depth right.
                              If I were to make this again I would 3D print something. But if I learned anything from intro to engineering it’s that
                              adjustability can make your life much easier and in this situation it did, as it took a lot of adjusting to get the
                              screen to sit just right.

                              The software I am running on this is a custom android app called Android Race Dash or ARD for short that I am
                              working on in my free time. Though I don’t have much of it these days, so development is pretty slow since I am not
                              only learning how to develop android apps in the process but also need to engineer some pretty complex operations
                              to get all the features I want to run efficiently given the OBDII protocol is not the fastest thing in the world.
                              If you are wanting to do this yourself, I would recommend going with the torque pro app while I am still in the
                              process of developing Android Race Dash. Here is the <a href="https://github.com/Amurdock6/Android-Race-Dash">GitHub Repo</a> if you want to fork my work or contribute to the

                        <p>
                              Now let’s dive into the wiring, the nitty-gritty details of connecting the Raspberry pi to the car's electrical
                              system efficiently, while avoiding unnecessary battery drain when the car is off. Below is the complete wiring
                              diagram I created. Following this and installing my shut down script will yield you the same results that I have
                              in my set up.
                        </p>
                        
                        <img class="full-size-image" src="/images/blog-posts/post1/wiring-diagram.webp" alt="Complete wiring diagram showing how the pi and all its related hardware is wired into the cars 12v system." data-enlargeable/>
                        
                        <hr />
                        
                        <p>
                              I am no electrical engineer so there might be an easier way to do this without the relays. That being said, this
                              setup is working great and I’ve had no issues.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>
                              The Raspberry pi 4B requires 5V to run, but since cars provide 12V, I needed to step the voltage down. To do this,
                              I used 12V to 5V DC-DC Buck Converters, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Converter-Voltage-Waterproof-Regulator-Step-Down/dp/B07Y2V1F8V/ref=asc_df_B07Y2V1F8V?mcid=4f9b9e4c200333ecafe22a27f0155c4e&tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=693558272631&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=12734499194843680300&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=1026984&hvtargid=pla-843941145334&th=1">these ones</a> 
                              specifically. While you can buy these converters with a
                              built-in USB-C output (making them plug-and-play), I decided to make my own connector instead of waiting for
                              another part to arrive.
                        </p>

                        <p>Here's what I did:</p>
                        <ul>
                              <li>
                                    I cut the USB-C connector off an old cable, stripped the wires, and soldered the positive and negative wires
                                    to the 5V output of the buck converter. This DIY approach works just as well and retains the Raspberry pi’s
                                    factory surge protection system, which is important for automotive environments with potential voltage
                                    spikes.
                              </li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>
                              I would recommend the simpler solution and just buy a buck converter that already comes with a 5V USB-C output and
                              another with the 5v bare wire output for the GPIO pins, but the way I did it is just as good if you have the spare
                              parts lying around and the know-how.
                        </p>

                        <h3>
                              Wiring the System: Accessory, Ground, and Constant Power   
                        </h3>
                        <p>
                              Next, I tapped into the car’s wiring harness behind the stereo to get power. Specifically, I used:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                              <li>
                                    Accessory power wire: This wire only provides power when the key is in the ignition and turned to the "ON"
                                    position. It serves as the trigger to start the system.
                              </li>
                              <li>
                                    Constant power wire: This wire supplies 12V at all times, even when the car is off, to keep the Raspberry pi
                                    powered during the shutdown process.
                              </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                              For the ground, I connected the circuit to a ground wire in the stereo harness, which is grounded to the chassis.
                              You can also ground it directly to any suitable point on the car’s frame.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Managing Shutdown with Relays</h3>
                        <p>
                              To avoid cutting power to the Pi abruptly (which could corrupt data or damage the SD card), I added a Main Power Timer Relay and a Normally Closed Relay:  
                        </p>

                        <ol>
                              <li>
                                    Main Power Timer Relay:<br>
                                    When the accessory power wire loses power (e.g., the car turns off), this relay continues supplying power to
                                    the Raspberry pi for 50 seconds. This gives the Pi enough time to execute a safe shutdown sequence.
                        
                              </li>
                              <li>
                                    Normally Closed Relay:<br>
                                    This relay monitors the accessory power wire. When it detects that accessory power is off, it sends a signal
                                    to one of the Pi’s GPIO pins (I used GPIO Pin 18) to initiate the shutdown script.
                              </li>
                        </ol>

                        <div class="image-container">
                              <img src="/images/blog-posts/post1/shutDownRelay.webp" alt="Picture showing the main power timer relay wired up in the glovebox." data-enlargeable/>

                        <p>
                              Finally, I added a kill switch to the system. This allows me to manually cut all power to the Raspberry pi and
                              relays when the car will be parked for an extended period, preventing battery drain.                  
                        </p>

                        <h3 id="shutdownscript">Writing the Shutdown Script for the Raspberry pi:</h3>
                        <p>
                              The shutdown script is a small piece of code I wrote in C, which monitors GPIO Pin 18 for a high signal. When the
                              Normally Closed Relay sends power to this pin, the script tells the Raspberry pi to begin the shutdown process.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>
                              The script itself was straightforward to write, but getting it to work on an Android-based OS running on the Pi
                              took some trial and error. Here’s what I did:
                        </p>
                        
                        <!-- Code Section -->
                        <p>Place the script in the <code>/system/bin</code> directory, as this is where executable scripts are stored in Android. Set the correct permissions using the following command:</p>

                        <p>
                              It’s been over a year since I installed the digital dash, and I’m happy to report that it’s been holding up
                              great! Overall, this project was well worth the time and money. I’d highly recommend it to anyone who needs a
                              digital dash and doesn’t mind tinkering or even someone who just wants to display or log data. All in all, I spent
                              around $280, and with this setup, I can monitor any data point the ECU supplies via OBDII, as well as additional
                              inputs from other sensors. Plus, the customization options and functionality far outweigh the limitations of
                              traditional single-use gauges.
                              <br>
                              <br>
                              For example, a single AEM gauge costs around $200, only displays one data point, and takes up significant space.
                              With this digital dash, not only do I save money, but I also get the freedom to customize the interface however I
                              like. The amount of functionality at this price point is unbeatable.
                              <br>
                              <br>
                              The main limitations are software and OBDII data transfer speeds. Torque Pro is an excellent app and meets most
                              needs, but it has its constraints. This is where my next project, Android Race Dash, will come in. I’m working on
                              creating an app tailored for this setup, but between school and work, progress is slower than I’d like. Stay tuned
                              for a future blog post about the state of the app and my plans for development.
                              <br>
                              <br>
                              OBDII speed concerns can also be addressed by utilizing the Pi’s GPIO pins to connect custom sensors for
                              time-sensitive data. This would allow for much faster readings, though it requires additional programming to make
                              use of these inputs. For less time-critical data, like temperatures, OBDII is plenty fast.
                              <br>
                              <br>
                              What would I do differently if I were to redo this project? Honestly, not much! One upgrade I plan to make is
                              switching to a faster OBDII scanner, like the OBDLink MX+, which is considered one of the fastest wireless options
                              for Android and is more compact than my current one.
                              <br>
                              <br>
                              I’d also 3D print a better mount for the screen. While my current mount has held up well, installing it was a bit
                              of a pain. The bolts were so close to the old nav housing that tightening them required some awkward maneuvering,
                              and the process involved a lot of dremeling and drilling. Although it works fine and keeps the screen flush, a
                              3D-printed mount would have been much easier to install and replicate in the future.
                              <br>
                              <br>
                              Aside from those small tweaks, I wouldn’t change much. This project went surprisingly smoothly, and I hope this
                              blog post saves you some of the research and trial-and-error I had to go through. It was a quick and rewarding
                              project overall, and I’m excited to see how it evolves over time.
                              <br>
                              <br>
                              Thank you for reading! I hope you found this guide helpful and that it saves you time on your own project. If you
